```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly, quietly = T, warn.conflicts = F)
```

## Task

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

I have decided to use the mtcars data set

```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

## Plot

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p <- plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, color = ~cyl, text = rownames(mtcars), type="scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(
    title = "A plot of weight vs miles per gallon for cars",
    xaxis = list(title="Weight"),
    yaxis = list(title="Miles per Gallon")
  )
p
```
